      <p>Solar - AEGOPL works with dozens of solar technology companies offering everything that is currently on the market for harvesting the sun's energy. We are able to design, engineer, build, and manage a variety of solar photovoltaic and solar concentrator arrays. We can design them as stand- alone systems, integrate them into the built environment (buildings, street lamps, civic infrastructure), and combine them with other visionary technologies such as " energy amplification technology" which can increase the output from this or any other power generation system many, many times at a fraction of the cost per kilowatt hour. These systems can be used to provide electricity, air conditioning, or provide potable water through desalinization. These systems can be used to provide electricity, air conditioning, or provide potable water through desalinization. These systems are most applicable for providing on-site energy and task specific electricity. AEGOPL is also at the forefront of "Nano- solar technology and solar paint development which should increase the current rate of solar conversion efficiency anywhere from 3 to 12 times their current rates of efficiency.</p>

      <h2>Wind</h2>
      <img class="floatleft" style="margin:0 20px 10px 0;" src="images/wind.jpg" width="250" height="250" />
      <p>AEGOPL works with the most innovative vertical and horizontal axis wind turbine companies in the world. Our engineers pioneered the modern use of wind turbine systems and were responsible for the very first major wind farms that were built in Altamont pass California. They are also responsible for the first building and transpiration integrated systems that utilize wind turbines as incorporated energy sources. These systems are used either for onsjte supplemental electricity production or in large farms to produce utility levels of electricity. Tidal and River Power - Systems that are able to harness ocean tidal flows and kinetic reiver energy are also part of the AEGOPL renewable energy portfolio. These are some of the most productive and expensive systems to engineer and require very specific attention to site development and suitability to make sense. These, systems are capable of producing electricity in the gigawatt range.</p>

      <h2>Waste to power</h2>
      <img class="floatleft" style="margin:0 20px 10px 0;" src="images/Waste%20to%20Power.jpg" width="250" height="250" />
      <p>Under certain circumstances AEGOPL will use waste to create electricity through a chemical conversion process (Paralysis) when there are no other good options available. It is our opinion however, that waste has a much higher value when used for fuel conversion and the creation of agricultural fertilizer, and therefore this is something we do only as a resort.</p>
